	<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download the latest version of Python.</a></li>
	<li>From there connect a macro to run the makeWl.py file through a key on your keyboard.</li>
<h4>Side Notes:</h4>
<ul>
	&emsp;-Some applications, like ICUE, don't allow the use of .py files to run through the application.<br/>
	&emsp;-If this is the case, simply use the .bat file. The .bat file is a script that simply runs makeWl.py. Therefore, both files are needed still!<br/>
	&emsp;-To remove the command prompt popup that appears for a second, follow these steps below:<br/>
	&emsp;1. Hit the Windowns key, type "Choose a default app for each type of file".<br/>

	&emsp;2. Scroll down until you see ".py" and make sure the file type ".py" has a default app of Python.<br/>
</ul>
